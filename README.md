# Presenter Mirror

## [Download (v0.3)](https://github.com/downloads/DouglasHeriot/PresenterMirror/PresenterMirror.app%200.35.zip)

**Requires OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion**. (Requires new `CGDisplayStream` APIs, probably created by Apple also for use in AirPlay mirroring)

## Backstory

So, you’ve got to present something on your Mac. Say, a live coding demo or a Photoshop tutorial.

What are your Mac’s display options?

* *Mirrored display mode* – Everyone can see everything you’re doing. No way to hide looking up your notes.

* *Extended desktop mode* – You can do whatever you want on your MacBook’s display, while presenting on a projector. *But how do you see what you’re doing?* Doesn’t work if you don’t have another monitor display set up, or if you want to awkwardly look at the projector behind you.

**Isn’t there a better way?**

## Presenter Mirror!

If you’re using extended desktop mode, Presenter Mirror can display the secondary display (which you probably have on a projector behind you) in a window on your desktop!

Works great with **retina MacBook Pro!** – You can make the window nice and small, and it’s still perfectly clear! Lots of room for your notes.

Having it in a small window has the added benefit of simulating what it’s like for your audience looking at the screen from a distance away – if text is too small to read in the small mirror window, it’s probably too small for your audience too!




## Getting the code
